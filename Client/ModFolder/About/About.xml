	<description>Open World is a work in progress mod that aims to achieve a fun and natural multiplayer experience in Rimworld. With it, you can experience all your normal and casual adventures that you would in a singleplayer, but now connected with a bunch of other players living the same as you do.

You can choose to help each other by providing support, or to transform into a world wide known enemy for all the players of the planet. Choose your lone wolf story, or join forces with players using factions. There are no rules but the ones you dictate yourself.

All data sent between clients of this mod and servers is encrypted.

Attention! This is a work in progress mod! Things are prone to breaking!
